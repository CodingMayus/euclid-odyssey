            The amount of power required to transmit data is synonymous with distance. So transferring planteary seismology research back to
            Earth requires large amounts of power at a time. However, this process becomes redundant as a only small fraction out of all the
            continuously recorded data is actually useful. When large amounts of data are being transferred, its resolution will be less
            optimal, highlighting the necessity for efficient data transmissions. Our goal is to differentiate seismic data from noise
            such that only useful data is being sent back to Earth.
